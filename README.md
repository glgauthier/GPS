# Kayak_GPS
A GPS tracker using an Arduino and Adafruit Ultimate GPS module

This project is inspired by and based on code taken from https://learn.adafruit.com/gps-dog-collar/code, and also relies on the TinyGPS library for Arduino (http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygps/)

I originally intended to create a GPS watch from scratch, but now I'm looking in to using the same code for a GPS tracker that I can use while I kayak.
